# Model Loading

X-AnyLabeling currently includes many built-in general-purpose models. For a detailed list, please refer to the [Model Zoo](../../docs/en/model_zoo.md).

## Loading Built-in Models

Before enabling the AI-assisted labeling feature, you need to load a model. This can be done via the `AI` icon button in the left sidebar or by using the shortcut `Ctrl+A`.

Typically, when you select a model from the dropdown list, the application checks if the corresponding model files exist in the user's directory at `~/xanylabeling_data/models/${model_name}`. If they exist, the model is loaded directly. Otherwise, the application automatically downloads the files from the network to the specified directory.

Note: All built-in models are hosted by default on GitHub Releases. Therefore, you need a stable internet connection with access to GitHub; otherwise, the download might fail.

For users who fail to load models due to network issues, options include downloading the model offline and loading it manually, or modifying the model download source.

### Offline Model Download

- Open the [model_zoo.md](./model_zoo.md) file and find the configuration file corresponding to the desired model.
- Edit the configuration file, modify the model path, and optionally adjust other hyperparameters as needed.
- In the tool's interface, click **Load Custom Model** and select the path to the configuration file.

### Modify Model Download Source

For details, please refer to section `7.7 Model Download Source Configuration` in [user_guide.md](./user_guide.md).

## Loading Adapted User Custom Models

> **Adapted Models** refer to models that have already been integrated into X-AnyLabeling, requiring no custom inference code from the user. A list of adapted models can be found in the [Model Zoo](../../docs/en/model_zoo.md).

In this tutorial, we will use the [YOLOv5s](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) model as an example to detail how to load a custom adapted model.

**a. Model Conversion**

Suppose you have trained a model locally. First, you can convert the `PyTorch` trained model to X-AnyLabeling's default `ONNX` file format (optional). Specifically, execute:

```bash
python export.py --weights yolov5s.pt --include onnx
```

Note: The current version does not support **dynamic inputs**, so do not set the `--dynamic` parameter.

Additionally, it is highly recommended to import the exported `*.onnx` file using the [Netron](https://netron.app/) online tool to check the input and output node information, ensuring dimensions and other details are as expected.

</p>

**b. Model Configuration**

Once the `onnx` file is ready, you can browse the [Model Zoo](../../docs/en/model_zoo.md) file to find and copy the configuration file for the corresponding model.

Taking [yolov5s.yaml](../../anylabeling/configs/auto_labeling/yolov5s.yaml) as an example, let's look at its content:

```YAML
type: yolov5
name: yolov5s-r20230520
provider: Ultralytics
display_name: YOLOv5s
model_path: https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling/releases/download/v0.1.0/yolov5s.onnx
iou_threshold: 0.45
conf_threshold: 0.25
classes:
  - person
  - bicycle
  - car
  ...
```

| Field          | Description                                                     | Modifiable |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| `type`         | Model type identifier, cannot be customized.                    | ❌         |
| `name`         | Index name of the model configuration file, keep default.       | ❌         |
| `provider`     | Model provider, can be modified based on actual situation.      | ✔️         |
| `display_name` | Name shown in the model dropdown list in the UI, customizable. | ✔️         |
| `model_path`   | Model loading path, supports relative and absolute paths.      | ✔️         |
| `iou_threshold`| IoU threshold for Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS).               | ✔️         |
| `conf_threshold`| Confidence threshold for NMS.                                  | ✔️         |
| `classes`      | List of model labels, must match the training labels.          | ✔️         |

Note that not all fields apply to every model. Refer to the definition of the specific model.

For example, looking at the implementation of the [YOLO](../../anylabeling/services/auto_labeling/__base__/yolo.py) base model, it offers additional optional configuration items:

| Field           | Description                   |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| `filter_classes`| Specify classes used during inference. |
| `agnostic`      | Use class-agnostic NMS.      |

Here's a typical example:

```YAML
type: yolov5
name: yolov5s-r20230520
provider: Ultralytics
display_name: YOLOv5s
model_path: /path/to/your/custom_yolov5s.onnx # Modified path
iou_threshold: 0.60
conf_threshold: 0.25
agnostic: True
filter_classes:
  - person
  - car
classes:
  - person
  - bicycle
  - car
  - ...
```

Specifically, only when using older versions of YOLOv5 (v5.0 and below), you need to specify the `anchors` and `stride` fields in the configuration file. Otherwise, **do not** specify these fields to avoid inference errors. Example:

```YAML
type: yolov5
...
stride: 32
anchors:
  - [10,13, 16,30, 33,23]  # P3/8
  - [30,61, 62,45, 59,119]  # P4/16
  - [116,90, 156,198, 373,326]  # P5/32
```

> **Tip**: For segmentation models, you can specify the `epsilon_factor` parameter to control the smoothness of the output contour points. The default value is `0.005`.

**c. Model Loading**

After understanding the above, modify the `model_path` field in the configuration file and optionally adjust other hyperparameters as needed.

The software currently supports both **relative paths** and **absolute paths** for model loading. When entering the model path, be mindful of escape characters.

Finally, in the model dropdown list in the top menu bar of the interface, find the `...Load Custom Model` option, and then import the prepared configuration file to complete the custom model loading process.

## Loading Unadapted User Custom Models

> **Unadapted Models** refer to models that have not yet been integrated into X-AnyLabeling. Users need to follow the implementation steps below for integration.

Here, we use a multi-class semantic segmentation model, `U-Net`, as an example. Follow these implementation steps:

**a. Training and Exporting Model**

Export the `ONNX` model, ensuring the output node dimension is `[1, C, H, W]`, where `C` is the total number of classes (including the background class).

> **Friendly Reminder**: Exporting to `ONNX` is optional. You can choose other model formats like `PyTorch`, `OpenVINO`, or `TensorRT` based on your needs. For an example using `Segment-Anything-2` for video object tracking, refer to the [Installation Guide](../../examples/interactive_video_object_segmentation/README.md), the configuration file definition [sam2_hiera_base_video.yaml](../../anylabeling/configs/auto_labeling/sam2_hiera_base_video.yaml), and the corresponding implementation [segment_anything_2_video.py](../../anylabeling/services/auto_labeling/segment_anything_2_video.py).

**b. Define Configuration File**

First, create a new configuration file, e.g., `unet.yaml`, in the [configuration directory](../../anylabeling/configs/auto_labeling):

```YAML
type: unet
name: unet-r20250101
display_name: U-Net (ResNet34)
provider: xxx
conf_threshold: 0.5
model_path: /path/to/best.onnx
classes:
  - cat
  - dog
  - _background_
```

Where:

| Field          | Description                                                      |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `type`         | Specifies the model type. Ensure it's unique from existing types to maintain identifier uniqueness. |
| `name`         | Defines the model index for internal reference and management. Avoid conflicts with existing indices. |
| `display_name` | The model name displayed in the UI for easy identification. Ensure uniqueness. |

These three fields are mandatory. Add other fields as needed, such as provider, model path, hyperparameters, etc.

**c. Add Configuration File**

Next, add the above configuration file to the [model management file](../../anylabeling/configs/models.yaml):

```yaml
...

- model_name: "unet-r20250101"
  config_file: ":/unet.yaml"
...
```

**d. Configure UI Components**

This step can add UI components as needed. Simply add the `model_type` to the corresponding list in the [file](../../anylabeling/services/auto_labeling/__init__.py).

**e. Define Inference Service**

A key step in defining the inference service is inheriting the [Model](../../anylabeling/services/auto_labeling/model.py) base class, which allows you to implement model-specific forward inference logic.

Specifically, create a new file `unet.py` in the [model inference service directory](../../anylabeling/services/auto_labeling/). Here's an example:

```python
import logging
import os

import cv2
import numpy as np
from PyQt5 import QtCore
from PyQt5.QtCore import QCoreApplication

from anylabeling.app_info import __preferred_device__
from anylabeling.views.labeling.shape import Shape

from .model import Model
from .types import AutoLabelingResult
from .engines.build_onnx_engine import OnnxBaseModel

        self.classes = self.config["classes"]
        self.input_shape = self.net.get_input_shape()[-2:]

    def preprocess(self, input_image):
        input_h, input_w = self.input_shape
        image = cv2.resize(input_image, (input_w, input_h))
        image = np.transpose(image, (2, 0, 1))

        return results

    def predict_shapes(self, image, image_path=None):
        if image is None:
            return []

        try:
            image = qt_img_to_rgb_cv_img(image, image_path)
        except Exception as e:  # noqa
            logging.warning("Could not inference model")
            logging.warning(e)
            return []

        blob = self.preprocess(image)
        outputs = self.net.get_ort_inference(blob)
        results = self.postprocess(image, outputs)
        shapes = []
        for item in results:
            label, contours = item
            for points in contours:
                # Make sure to close
                points += points[0]
                shape = Shape(flags={})
                for point in points:
                    shape.add_point(QtCore.QPointF(point[0], point[1]))
                shape.shape_type = "polygon"
                shape.closed = True
                shape.fill_color = "#000000"
                shape.line_color = "#000000"

                shape.selected = False
                shapes.append(shape)

        result = AutoLabelingResult(shapes, replace=True)
        return result

    def unload(self):
        del self.net
```

Here:

-   In the `Meta` class:
    -   `required_config_names`: Specifies mandatory fields in the model config file for proper initialization.
    -   `widgets`: Specifies controls (buttons, dropdowns, etc.) to display for this service. See [this file](../../anylabeling/services/auto_labeling/__init__.py) for definitions.
    -   `output_modes`: Specifies the output shape types supported (e.g., polygon, rectangle, rotated box).
    -   `default_output_mode`: Specifies the default output shape type.
-   `predict_shapes` and `unload` are abstract methods that **must** be implemented. They define the inference process and resource release logic, respectively.

**f. Add to Model Management**

After the above steps, open the [model configuration file](../../anylabeling/services/auto_labeling/__init__.py). Add the corresponding model type field (e.g., `unet`) to the `_CUSTOM_MODELS` list and, if necessary, add the model name to relevant configuration sections.

> **Tip**: If you don't know how to implement specific widgets, use the search panel, enter relevant keywords, and examine the implementation logic of available widgets.

Finally, go to the [Model Manager class file](../../anylabeling/services/auto_labeling/model_manager.py). In the `_load_model` method, initialize your instance as follows:

```python
...

class ModelManager(QObject):
    """Model manager"""

    def __init__(self):
        ...
    ...
    def _load_model(self, model_id):
        """Load and return model info"""
        if self.loaded_model_config is not None:
            self.loaded_model_config["model"].unload()
            self.loaded_model_config = None
            self.auto_segmentation_model_unselected.emit()

        model_config = copy.deepcopy(self.model_configs[model_id])
        if model_config["type"] == "yolov5":
            ...
        elif model_config["type"] == "unet":
            from .unet import UNet

            try:
                model_config["model"] = UNet(
                    model_config, on_message=self.new_model_status.emit
                )
                self.auto_segmentation_model_unselected.emit()
            except Exception as e:  # noqa
                self.new_model_status.emit(
                    self.tr(
                        "Error in loading model: {error_message}".format(
                            error_message=str(e)
                        )
                    )
                )
                print(
                    "Error in loading model: {error_message}".format(
                        error_message=str(e)
                    )
                )
                return
          ...
    ...
```

⚠️Note:

-   The model type field must match the `type` field defined in the configuration file (Step **b. Define Configuration File**).
-   If the model is based on `SAM` (Segment Anything Model) interaction patterns, replace `self.auto_segmentation_model_unselected.emit()` with `self.auto_segmentation_model_selected.emit()` to trigger the corresponding functionality. (Or better, use a configuration flag as shown in the example code).
